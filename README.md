- 👋 Hi, I’m @GoldenAviFelman Cryptocurrency Trader and Enthusiast 
- 👀 I’m interested in Solidity Contracts, Cryptocurrency trading, creating DApps to be used on the blockchain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Blockchain Development, Web3 Decentralized Applications, AI Technology
- 💞️ I’m here to offer an opportunity to collaborate with our experience and profit from our trade signals.
- 
-    This repository is for a personal Escrow Account where you will deposit 1 ETH as your collateral.
-    The account is where your ETH is held while we perform trades(which we perform during a 4HR period)
-    We do not have access to your ETH as you are the owner of the contract.
-    (our code is clear of obfuscation or malicious activity and there is no address of ours to back door)
-    With that being said we are only trading with 100 people(.01BTC welcome bonus before we make any trades) 
-
